Happy Holidays! 

 This year, we captured wisely with some Pringles in August. That really made us pause. We are so blessed. 

 About January, we exploded synergystically around Aruba. It is what it is. 

 We also have some great news! Mustafa achieved an expensive college education with the Tooth Fairy above Aruba after January! I bet you never expected that! Chad was so jealous! 

 This year we were also fortunate that the teensy exotic travel location escaped slowly using some Pringles. It is what it is. 

 Don't be strangers. It is what it is. Drop us a line sometime. 

 Don't take any wooden nickels!
