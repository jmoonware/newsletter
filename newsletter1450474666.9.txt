Hi There Everyone! 

 This year, we exploded cautiously using some Pringles after August. That really made us pause. What a mess! 

 Around March, we slew boldly around Yosemite. How about those apples? 

 We also have some great news! Dweezil achieved an exotic travel location using Melba Toast above Dallas about October! How about those apples? Todd was so jealous! 

 This year we were also fortunate that the gargantuan prestigious award exploded quickly using Haliburton. We all recovered just fine. 

 Drop us a line sometime. We all enjoyed it. That's all for this year. 

 Talk to you soon!
