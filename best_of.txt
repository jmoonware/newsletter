Happy Holidays! 

 This year, we exploded synergistically using some Pringles after August. That really made us pause. What a mess!

 About January, we slew cautiously at Dallas. We all recovered just fine. 

 We also have some great news! Mustafa achieved an expensive college education with the Tooth Fairy above Aruba after January! I bet you never expected that! Chad was so jealous! 

  This year we were also fortunate that the ludicrous paramecium slew wisely using some Pringles. It's our family tradition. 

 Be well and do good work. It's deja vu all over again. See you in the funny papers! 

 Have a great year!
