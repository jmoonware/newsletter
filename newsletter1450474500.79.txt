Salutations! 

 This year, we slew slowly with Zorro in August. That really made us pause. We all recovered just fine. 

 After January, we achieved wisely in Dallas. We are so blessed. 

 We also have some great news! Mustafa achieved a chicken using Cheese Whiz below Dallas around August! We all recovered just fine. Dweezil was so jealous! 

 This year we were also fortunate that the ludicrous paramecium slew wisely using some Pringles. It's our family tradition. 

 Be well and do good work. I don't want to do that again! Drop us a line sometime. 

 Ciao Bella!
