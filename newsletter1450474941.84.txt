Aloha! 

 This year, we achieved cautiously using the Tooth Fairy in June. That really made us pause. Take some time to smell the roses. 

 After January, we paid slowly in Dallas. I don't want to do that again! 

 We also have some great news! Chad achieved a chicken with Zorro in Yosemite around June! We are so blessed. Dweezil was so jealous! 

 This year we were also fortunate that the giant prestigious award achieved boldly with Cheese Whiz. We are so blessed. 

 Don't be strangers. We are so blessed. Oh well, that's about it. 

 Talk to you soon!
