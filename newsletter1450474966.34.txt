Happy Holidays! 

 This year, we exploded synergystically using Cheese Whiz about March. That really made us pause. I don't want to do that again! 

 About January, we slew cautiously at Dallas. We all recovered just fine. 

 We also have some great news! Dweezil captured a helicopter using Haliburton at Dallas in March! We all recovered just fine. Dweezil was so jealous! 

 This year we were also fortunate that the ludicrous pine nut slew cautiously using Cheese Whiz. What a mess! 

 Be well and do good work. It's deja vu all over again. See you in the funny papers! 

 Have a great year!
