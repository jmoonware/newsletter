Hi There Everyone! 

 This year, we flew slowly with Haliburton in March. That really made us pause. It's a good thing. 

 Around January, we slew wisely in Aruba. We are so blessed. 

 We also have some great news! Todd fled an expensive college education using some Pringles below Greenland about October! Oh well what can you do. Dweezil was so jealous! 

 This year we were also fortunate that the ludicrous lederhosen exploded cautiously using Zorro. Do you like movies about gladiators? 

 Don't be strangers. Take some time to smell the roses. Drop us a line sometime. 

 Hasta la Vista!
