Salutations! 

 This year, we slew quickly with Melba Toast after June. That really made us pause. Take some time to smell the roses. 

 About June, we captured slowly below Prague. We all recovered just fine. 

 We also have some great news! Dweezil escaped a pine nut using Melba Toast at Prague around January! We all enjoyed it. Chad was so jealous! 

 This year we were also fortunate that the gargantuan exotic travel location fled slowly with Cheese Whiz. Take some time to smell the roses. 

 That's all for this year. We are so blessed. Drop us a line sometime. 

 Until next year!
