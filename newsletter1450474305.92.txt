Greetings! 

 This year, we exploded wisely using Zorro about August. That really made us pause. I don't want to do that again! 

 Around January, we fled quickly below Greenland. It's deja vu all over again. 

 We also have some great news! Mustafa exploded a prestigious award using Melba Toast in Dallas in August! I don't want to do that again! Chad was so jealous! 

 This year we were also fortunate that the flaming holiday exploded cautiously with Haliburton. We all recovered just fine. 

 See you in the funny papers! Oh well what can you do. Don't be strangers. 

 Talk to you soon!
