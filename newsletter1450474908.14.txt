Happy Holidays! 

 This year, we fled slowly using some Pringles in March. That really made us pause. We are so blessed. 

 After March, we achieved quickly below Greenland. We are so blessed. 

 We also have some great news! Dweezil achieved a chicken with Melba Toast in Dallas after October! We all enjoyed it. Mustafa was so jealous! 

 This year we were also fortunate that the ludicrous Christmas tree captured wisely with Zorro. It's a good thing. 

 That's all for this year. What a mess! Drop us a line sometime. 

 Talk to you soon!
